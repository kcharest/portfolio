                <p>In the world of mobile apps there is always a need to create both something useful and intuitive. The core of creating an app like Ciao Chow was driven by user centered design. Bringing the world of food trucks to a user’s finger tips should be easy, convenient, and provide a satisfying user experience and such was the goal of Ciao Chow. It was my job to complete these goals.</p>

                <h3>the problem</h3>
                <p>The design problems presented in creating the Ciao Chow app were few but important. There needed to be a way for app users to find food trucks in their immediate area, there needed to be access to individual food truck menus that users could browse, and there needed to be a way to order food from their desired food truck directly from the user’s mobile device.<br> <br>
                
                To begin solving the problems I first had to know what were the user expectations and how could I meet them. When it came to realizing the design for the Ciao Chow app, there was a great deal of information from potential users that was gathered and analysed. This data was first formulated into user stories that determined the flow and features of the app to be created.</p>
